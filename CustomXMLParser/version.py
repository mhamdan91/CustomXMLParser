Custom XML to Dict Parser
==============================

 * [Library Installalion](#library-installalion)
 * [Library Usage](#library-usage)
 * [Config file](#config-file)


## Overview
This package allows you to parse XML files. The tool uses the `xml2dict` package to parse XML files in raw format and returns data as a python dictionary and builds on that to provide custom tailoring of what information to return from the XML file. In other words, with a configuration file, you can return specific data from the XML file in a specific format.

## Library Installalion
To install the library simply run the following command in a cmd, shell or whatever...

```bash
# It's recommended to create a virtual environment

# Windows
pip install CustomXMLParser

# Linux
pip3 install CustomXMLParser
```

## Library usage?

### Example usage
If you wish to read the XML file as is and simply convert it to a python dictionary, then do the following:
```python
from CustomXMLParser import XmlParser

xml_parser = XmlParser(parser_type='raw')
xml_file = 'path_to_xml_file'
xml_dict = xml_parser.parse(xml_file)
```

If you wish to dump a dict to XML file or a string, then do the following:
```python
from CustomXMLParser import XmlParser
xml_parser = XmlParser(parser_type='raw')
xml_file = 'path_to_xml_file'
xml_dict = xml_parser.parse(xml_file)
my_dict = manipulate(xml_dict) # Manipulate raw dict, but MUST maintain structure
out_xml_file = 'path_to_out_xml_file'
xml_parser.dump(out_xml_file, my_dict, pretty=True) # This dump dict to xml file
my_xml_string = xml_parser.dumps(data, pretty=True) # This dumps dict to a string
```


If you wish to read specific portions of the XML file and format them in a particular way, then do the following:
```python
from CustomXMLParser import XmlParser

config_file = 'path_to_config_file'
xml_parser = XmlParser(config_file=config_file, parser_type='custom')
xml_file = 'path_to_xml_file'
xml_dict = xml_parser.parse(xml_file)
```

If you wish to dump a any dict to XML file or a string, then do the following:
```python
from CustomXMLParser import XmlParser
xml_parser = XmlParser(parser_type='raw')
xml_file = 'path_to_xml_file'
xml_dict = xml_parser.parse(xml_file)
my_dict = manipulate(xml_dict)... # Manipulate raw dict, but MUST maintain structure
out_xml_file = 'path_to_out_xml_file'
xml_parser.dump(my_dict, out_xml_file, input_format='custom', root='root', pretty=True) # This dump dict to xml file
my_xml_string = xml_parser.dumps(my_dict, input_format='custom', root='root', pretty=True) # This dumps dict to a string
```


Note, the `XmlParser` class uses the following default XML attributes

```python
'''
name_key (str, optional): this is a custom/xml configuration parameter, and it is the name of primary tag. Defaults to "@name".
table_key (str, optional): this is a custom/xml configuration parameter, and it is the table identifier. Defaults to "th".
header_key (str, optional): this is a custom/xml configuration parameter, and it is the header identifier. Defaults to 'header'.
data_key (str, optional): this is a custom/xml configuration parameter, and it is the data identifier. Defaults to "rows".
header_text_key (str, optional): this is a custom/xml configuration parameter, and it is the table's key identifier. Defaults to "#text".
'''
```

You can override those attributes by passing them to the constructor of the `XmlParser` class as follows:

```python
from CustomXMLParser import XmlParser

config_file = 'path_to_config_file'
xml_parser = XmlParser(config_file=config_file, parser_type='custom', encoding='utf-8',
                       name_key='<desired_name_key>', table_key='<desired_table_key>', header_key='<desired_header_keyr>',
                       data_key='<desired_data_key>', header_text_key='<desired_header_text_key>')
xml_file = 'path_to_xml_file'
xml_dict = xml_parser.parse(xml_file)
```

## Config file

Below shows an example of configurations for custom parsing of XML.

```json
{
  "TREE":{
    "TABLE_A": {},
    "TABLE_B": {"TABLE_C": {"KEYS": "key1,key2"}}
  },

  "TABLE_A":
    [
      "element0_tag,element0_name",
      "element1_tag,element1_name"
    ],
  "TABLE_B":
    [
      "element0_tag*,element1_tag*,element2_tag,element2_name"
    ],
  "TABLE_C":
    [
      "element0_tag,element0_name"
    ]
}

```

### General Rules
- Capitalize all dictionary keys.
- \* is wildcard notation: returns data for all available elements

### Tree structure
The structure can be flat or nested. If you wish to return child data for a particular parent, then you have to include the child as value for the parent. For example, parent **TABLE_B** has child **TABLE_C**. If **TABLE_C** has a child of its own, then we add it to **TABLE_C** in the same way.

```yaml
REQUESTING_SPECIFIC_KEYS:
  notice that **TABLE_C** specifies a key called `KEYS` and a value of `key1,key2`.
  This configuration allows you to only return matching keys `key1` and `key2` for *TABLE_C*.
  If the `KEYS` key is not specified, then all keys are returned by default.
  The `KEYS` key must be unique and is not present in the XML file. If it is present,
  then user can change the default key name through class attributes.

```

### Data structure
Let's make some assumptions about elements to make this example easy to follow.
- For **TABLE_A**, assume element0_tag and element1_tag map to `table`, element0_name to `info`, and element1_name to `metadata`.
- For **TABLE_B**, assume element0_tag maps to `container`, element1_tag to `node`, and element2_tag to `table`, and element2_name to `info`.
- For **TABLE_C**, assume element0_tag maps to `table` and element0_name to `images`

In the above config example, we are interested in returning data for **TABLE_A**, **TABLE_B**, AND **TABLE_C**.
For each key, a path or a list of paths (xpath) is/are required to be provided in order to retrieve data from the XML file. For example:
- **TABLE_A** has two paths ["table,info", "table,metadata"], data under `info` and `metadata` tables will be returned and stored in *TABLE_A*
- **TABLE_B** has single path ["container*,node*,table,images"], data under `info` table for all nodes and all containers will be returned and stored in *TABLE_B*.
- **TABLE_C** has single path ["table,images"], data under `images` table for all parent nodes and containers will be returned and stored in *TABLE_C*. 

```yaml
NOTICE:
  full path isn't required for **TABLE_C** and the *GFC* (greatest common factor) between the child **TABLE_C**,
  and the parent **TABLE_B** is only required in the parent table. Since **TABLE_C** is a child of **TABLE_B**,
  it falls under the same path, but **TABLE_C** breaks away at "table,images" and that's why it is the only specified path.
  In other words, since **TABLE_C** is a child of **TABLE_B**, all *TABLE_B* rules carry over to *TABLE_C*. 
```
